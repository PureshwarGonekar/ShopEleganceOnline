 
1. What is Node.js?
Node.js is an open-source JavaScript runtime environment built on Chrome's V8
JavaScript engine. It allows developers to execute JavaScript code on the server-side,
enabling server-side scripting and the development of scalable network applications.

2. What are the key features of Node.js?
Some key features of Node.js include:

3. Asynchronous and event-driven: It uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model,
making it efficient and scalable.

4. Single-threaded: It employs a single-threaded event loop to handle concurrent
requests efficiently.

5. NPM (Node Package Manager): It provides a vast collection of reusable packages and
modules.

6. Cross-platform: Node.js is compatible with multiple operating systems.

7. What is NPM?

package name. For example, npm install express installs the Express framework.
9. Explain the concept of the event loop in Node.js.
The event loop is a key feature of Node.js that allows it to handle concurrent requests
efficiently. It constantly listens for events, such as I/O operations or timers, and
executes the associated callback functions when an event occurs. This non-blocking
approach ensures that the server can handle multiple requests without getting
blocked.

10. What is a callback function in Node.js?
A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function
and is executed later when a specific event occurs. In Node.js, callbacks are widely
used for handling asynchronous operations, such as reading files or making HTTP
requests.
